// HAND EDIT (MCC will revert on regenerate -- these values are device defaults,
// they are NOT stored in new_pic.mc3): IESO and FCMEN are both meaningless with
// FOSC = INTOSC -- there is no external oscillator to switch over to or to
// monitor -- while FCMEN keeps the LFINTOSC running permanently as its sample
// clock. Turning both off costs nothing and saves that idle current.
